## Hi, welcome to wike's first attempt at making a chrome extension. 
This tool was designed to help the moderators of Sonic 06 speedrunning on speedrun.com to port the vast amount of IL times that exist on soniccenter.org to SRC IL leaderboards.

I ported it to lost world.

### Usage:
 - Open an IL leaderboard on TSC
 - Open the same IL leaderboard on SRC in a separate window
 - Click the "Copy Data" button on one of the TSC entries
 - Click the "Submit Run" button on the SRC page
 - Double check the data in the form and hit submit
 - Rinse and repeat :)


 ####TO DO:
 - ignore banned TSC users
 - automatically move video links to the video link input field
 - convert from semi-automatic to controlled burst
